    "### 2. Standard headers for different modules\n",
    "For better understanding and maintenance of the code, the header of different modules should follow some standard format and information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Naming conventions for local variables, global variables, constants and functions\n",
    "Meaningful and understandable variables name helps anyone to understand the reason of using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Indentation\n",
    "Proper indentation is very important to increase the readability of the code. For making the code readable, programmers should use White spaces properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Error return values and exception handling conventions\n",
    "All functions that encountering an error condition should either return a 0 or 1 for simplifying the debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Avoid using a coding style that is too difficult to understand\n",
    "Code should be easily understandable. The complex code makes maintenance and debugging difficult and expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Avoid using an identifier for multiple purposes\n",
    "Each variable should be given a descriptive and meaningful name indicating the reason behind using it. This is not possible if an identifier is used for multiple purposes and thus it can lead to confusion to the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Code should be well documented\n",
    "The code should be properly commented for understanding easily. Comments regarding the statements increase the understandability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Length of functions should not be very large\n",
    "Lengthy functions are very difficult to understand. That’s why functions should be small enough to carry out small work and lengthy functions should be broken into small ones for completing small tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.Try not to use GOTO statement\n",
    "GOTO statement makes the program unstructured, thus it reduces the understandability of the program and also debugging becomes difficult."
